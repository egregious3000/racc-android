racc-android
============

Android version of raccdoc client.  Suitable for beta testing.

You can see the list of unread forums, read the unread messages, and make posts into those forums.

USAGE NOTES:

Use the "Back" button instead of the one built into your phone.

ISSUES:

You can't see posts you've already read, or interact with forums that don't already have unread messages.

The messages you read here are not marked as read on the BBS.
